# SWEET-SPS: Sparse Weighted Error Iteration for Spatial Sound

SWEET-SPS is a Python implementation of the framework introduced in Izquierdo *et al* ``Towards Maximizing a Perceptual *Sweet Spot* for Spatial Sound with Loudspeakers.'' 

## Dependencies

To run the scripts and code you need to install the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `cvxpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sps`
- `json`
- `warnings`
- `abc`
- `time`
- `collections`
